This guide provides an introduction to navigating and effectively using the **[Lane Cluster](https://www.cbd.cmu.edu/research/computational-biology-cluster/)** — a high-performance computing (**HPC**) resource maintained by the **[Ray and Stephanie Lane Computational Biology Department](https://www.cbd.cmu.edu/)** at **[Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/)**.

It is intended for **students, researchers, and collaborators** who wish to leverage the cluster for computational biology research and data-intensive analysis.

The guide covers key topics such as:

- Connecting to the cluster via SSH or remote environments  
- Managing computational jobs using the scheduler  
- Organizing data and using storage resources effectively  
- Accessing and loading software modules for analysis workflows  
- Following best practices for resource allocation and collaboration  

By the end of this guide, users will be familiar with the essential tools and procedures to work productively on the Lane Cluster environment.
