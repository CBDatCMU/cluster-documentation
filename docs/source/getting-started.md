## What is the Lane cluster?

The Lane cluster provides a powerful high-performance computing (HPC) environment for researchers working with computational biology, genomics, machine learning, and data-intensive scientific workflows. This chapter introduces the essential concepts you need before running your first job, including how to access the system, navigate the filesystem, load software with environment modules, and submit workloads with SLURM.

## Who can access the cluster?

Access to the Lane Cluster is limited to members of the Ray and Stephanie Lane Center for Computational Biology or collaborating labs. The cluster is intended to support computational biology, genomics, machine learning, and data-intensive scientific research.

Users must be sponsored by a CMU faculty member, typically a principal investigator (PI) whose research relies on computational resources. Students, postdocs, research staff, and collaborators may receive access as part of a faculty-led project.

If you are unsure whether you are eligible, start by speaking with your advisor or PI to determine whether your project aligns with the cluster’s intended use and to initiate the sponsorship process.

### How to Request an Account

If you require access to the Lane cluster, consult your advisor to initiate the sponsorship process.
:::

Access to the Lane Cluster requires sponsorship from a CMU faculty member whose research aligns with the mission of the Lane Center for Computational Biology. If you need access for a course, rotation, research project, or collaboration, follow the steps below to initiate the request.

#### Confirm Eligibility

Before submitting a request, verify that
* You are a CMU/Pitt student, postdoc, staff member, or collaborator working under an approved PI.
* Your project includes computational work appropriate for the cluster.
* Your advisor or PI is willing to sponsor your access.

If you are unsure, speak with your advisor to confirm your eligibility.

#### Contact Your Advisor or PI

Your sponsor must authorize your access. Most users begin by:
* Discussing the computational nee ds of their project
* Confirming that Lane is the appropriate resource
* Asking the PI to approve account creation

Advisors do not need to provide funding or project information depending on internal policies.

### Submit an Account Request

Once approved by your sponsor, the sponsor or an admin will submit an account request using the Lane Center’s designated process.

### Wait for Account Provisioning

System administrators will review your request and create your account. Provisioning time may vary depending on the number of pending requests.
