- Follow consistent **code style** (PEP8 for Python, or project conventions).
- Include **clear commit messages** describing *why* a change was made.
  - Example:
    ```
    feat: add Singularity section to advanced topics
    fix: correct path to virtual environment in README
    ```
- Test your changes before committing:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```
  or the test suite defined in your repo.
